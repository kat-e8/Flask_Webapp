# Flask_Webapp
Basic web application created using Python's Flask

To create an image of an application. Decide on a base OS,
install python and and add the flask module to it,
You load the app inside the container and
You tell flask to run the file file pointed to on the
specified host.

Flask is like a Python web framework, similar to what
Express is to Node. In essence we've created a Flask 
application called app.py. In the Dockerfile we define
the environment that the application will run on. Environment
is a combination of OS and packages installed on that OS that
the application will need.

Docker is a template on how to create an image.
